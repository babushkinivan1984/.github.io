            <p class="salutation">Dear Dr. Singer, it's me, the stomach.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">You probably don't recognize me. I used to be strong and inconspicuous, as I should be. My work was rhythmic and precise: receive, mix, send onward. I never caused any trouble. Ivan and I lived in perfect harmony.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Then everything changed.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">First, an <span class="medical-terms">Alien</span> took up residence inside me. It was large and hard. It interfered with my work, pressed against my walls, distorted my shape. I sent signals—a dull pain, a feeling of fullness—but for a long time, no one understood them.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Then you came, Dr. Singer. You found my intruder. You said it was evil, that its name was <span class="medical-terms">GIST</span>, and that it could kill both me and Ivan. I was terrified. But you said there would be a battle, and that you would save us.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">And then came the day of the battle.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">I remember the cold of anesthesia, and then—the cutting pain. Not from the Alien, but from you. Your hands breached my fortress, my walls. You cut away a whole piece of me—the part where the Alien was lodged. You cut me right near the Entrance, the most important place where I connect to the Supreme Pathway. It was terrifying and painful. You sewed me back together with a new, unfamiliar seam. It pulls and stings.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">I woke up in a new world, Dr. Singer. A world where I am disabled.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">My room became smaller. Now, when Ivan puts food inside me, I fill up almost instantly, and I have nowhere to put it. I used to be a spacious hall; now I am a cramped closet. My muscles, which once worked like a harmonious orchestra, are now confused. Sometimes I push the food onward too quickly, and then Ivan's whole body weakens and breaks out in a sweat. It's my fault.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">I hear Ivan say: "My stomach is disabled." And I know he is right.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                But, Dr. Singer, I want to tell you one thing. I am not angry with you.
            </div>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Because you were right about one thing: you killed the Alien. You cut it out. And when your colleagues put it under glass and examined it, it turned out it wasn't an evil <span class="medical-terms">GIST</span>, but just a <span class="medical-terms">Cyst</span>. A rough, large, but not fatal one.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">You fought what you believed was a dragon, but you killed a shadow. And I, your ally, sustained the heaviest wounds in that battle.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">So who am I now, Dr. Singer?</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">I am not a hero, because I didn't defeat a real enemy. I am not a victim, because you acted to save a life. I am a casualty of friendly fire.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">My request to you, Dr. Singer, is not a medical one. It is a human one. Please, help Ivan understand. Tell him not to blame me. To not call me disabled. To help me.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">I am not asking for my past back. I am asking for help to accept the present. Give us—give him—the rules to live by. Small portions. Quiet, soft food. Time. And patience.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">I can no longer work as I did before. But I can still work. I am still a <span class="medical-terms">STOMACH</span>. It's just that now, I am a stomach that survived the operation you performed. And I want Ivan and me to be a team again. Even if crippled, we are alive, thanks to you and yet because of you.</p>
            
            <div class="signature">
                <p>Sincerely,</p>
                <p class="name">Your former patient.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="postscript">
                P.S. Please tell Ivan that I'm doing my best.
